The avlTree.cpp source-code file is the C++ implementation of an AVL tree. The avlMap.cpp source-code file is the C++ implementation of a key-to-value map based on an AVL tree. The words.txt file is a dictionary of words used to test avlMap.cpp.

The 'node' class in both source-code files uses template parameters to specify the key and value types.

Each source-code file includes a main function that tests the AVL tree or map.
