The avlTree.cpp source-code file is an implementation of an AVL tree. The avlMap.cpp source-code file is an implementation of a key-to-value map based on an AVL tree. The words.txt file is a dictionary of words used to test avlMap.cpp.

The C++ code was created by translating Pascal code from Nicklaus Wirth's textbook, "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" and then modifying the del procedure to fix a bug and to improve performance as described in the above articles.
