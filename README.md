The avlTree.cpp source-code file is the C++ implementation of an AVL tree. The avlMap.cpp source-code file is the C++ implementation of a key-to-value map based on an AVL tree.

These implementations are transcribed from the Pascal search procedure and delete, balance1, balance2, and del procedures from pages 220-221 and pages 223-225 respectively of Nicklaus Wirth's textbook, "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" (Prentice-Hall, 1976) with the following two modifications. (1) The bug in the del procedure (i.e., a missing 'q := r;' statement) has been fixed. (2) When it is necessary to delete a node that has two children, instead of always replacing that node with the rightmost node of the left sub-tree (as performed in the del procedure), that node is replaced by either the rightmost node of the left sub-tree or the leftmost node of the right sub-tree. The replacement node is chosen according to the balance of the tree in an attempt to minimize subsequent rebalancing. If the right sub-tree is deeper than the left sub-tree, the replacement node is chosen from the right sub-tree; otherwise, the replacement node is chosen from the left sub-tree.

The key type in avlTree.cpp and the key and value types in avlMap.cpp are specified via templates.

Each source-code file includes a main function that tests the AVL tree or map. The words.txt file is a dictionary of words used to test avlMap.cpp.
